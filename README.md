The most important thing to know about me is that I am thankful for all the experiences and people that have helped me become the person I am today. I believe Life on Earth is Incredible. Life is so precious so I want to be very purposeful with my time. I Live Equally by being friendly, polite, and open-minded. I have the ability to build web apps that help people so that's how I choose to spend my time.

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer and mainly use the following technologies:

● ReactJS (Front End Development)
● NodeJS (Server Building)
● Express (Server Building)
● SQL (Database)

However, I'm not limited to using only those technologies and am learning new technologies and skills everyday!

*I have the ability to work remote from my home office or in person in an office in the Denver Metro area.
