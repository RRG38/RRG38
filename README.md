The most important thing to know about me:

I am thankful for all the experiences and people that have helped me become the person I am today. I believe above all else that Life on Earth is Incredible. Life is so precious to me that I am very purposeful with my time. I want to spend my time Living Equally by being friendly, polite, open-minded, and building a community for others who are also trying to make positive contributions to humanity.








Other details:

I'm a husband and father. I'm a world wide web developer. I play ice hockey and golf once a week.

There's not much more to me, but I do think the world wide web is a powerful tool that can help us connect and I have ideas on how. Let's face it, that's why we all become developers right, we have ideas that we think can help others and we have the skills to execute those ideas now! I really enjoy being a part of that community. To be honest I'm not going to post anything, but please reach out to me to connect and we can direct message.
