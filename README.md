The most important thing to know about me:


I am thankful for all the experiences and people that have helped me become the person I am today.

I believe above all else that Life on Earth is Incredible. Life is so precious to me that I am very purposeful with my time.

I want to spend my time Living Equally by being friendly, polite, open-minded, and building a community for others who are also trying to make positive contributions to humanity.




Other details:

My wife and I have a daughter. I spend my time with family. I spend my time building my own web apps and helping others build their web apps. I play golf and hockey once a week.

There's not much more to me, but I do think the world wide web is a powerful tool that can help us connect and I have ideas on how. I really enjoy being a part of the web app developer community.




*I have the ability to work remote or in person in an office in the Denver Metro area.
